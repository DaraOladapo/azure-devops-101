# Azure DevOps 101

During my career as a Software Developer and DevOps Engineer, I have learnt quite a bit with gotchas here and there with each new deployment activity I undertake. During the days I started learning Azure DevOps (yeah - Azure DevOps), there was not a lot of documentations and guides on the zero to hero kind of trainings. I just picked things up along this way.

In this brief guide, I will put together what I believe should be the steps to take to get started with Azure DevOps - that's DevOps using Microsoft all-in-one DevOps solution.

I hope you enjoy it.
